Actually, cultivars. Coffee cultivars are any variety produced by horticulture or agricultural techniques, therefore cultivated. In our periodic table of coffea varieties you’ll find all the major cultivars in history through modern types, including one whose origin hasn’t been named yet! Periodic table infographic made and originally posted by the Coffee Co-Mission.
Arabica — Original variety. Represents between seventy and seventy-five percent of world production. Originally indigenous to the mountains of the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia. It is also known as the “coffee shrub of Arabia”, “mountain coffee” or “Arabica coffee”. Coffea arabica is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated. The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, around Mocha in Yemen.

Robusta — Original variety. The bean comes from the Coffea Robusta variety of the Coffea canephora plant (widely known itself by the synonym Coffea Robusta) which has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Robusta is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield than arabica coffea, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants than arabica coffea, and is less susceptible to disease. Roasted Robusta beans produce a strong, full-bodied coffee with a distinctive earthy flavour, but usually with more bitterness than Arabica due to its pyrazine content.
